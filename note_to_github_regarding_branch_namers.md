I just wasted 20 minutes trying to set up a new repo on github, as I didin't understand why I couldn't do **git push origin master** 

Turns out it was due to this stupid decision of github (since Oct 1 2020) to now default to 'main' instead of 'master'.

This is beyond ridiculous. For a start, nobody calls a branch 'slave' - the counterpart to 'master' is usually something like 'dev' , so the whole master-slave paradigm just breaks down.

'Master' simply refers to the master copy, and doesn't embody the semantics of subjugation or enslavement.

ffs, keep your stupid politics out of it - I don't want any part of this insane ideology. I'm actually offended by this change.

The day github forces me to change my branch names for existing repos from "master" to "main" is the day I move all of my code elsewhere. 

Actually, I will probably make the move long before then.

You can stick it up your ass !
